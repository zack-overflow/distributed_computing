## INTRODUCTION

In this final module, you will learn about vector stores and see how they are used in practice. You will get started with the commercial vector store Pinecone and use it for semantic search. The *random projection* method can be a useful way to speed up search while making an approximation. You will read a paper demonstrating its utility.

## Learning Objectives

At the conclusion of this module, you should be able to:

- Explain uses cases for vector embeddings
- Explain the value of a vector store
- Apply Pinecone for semantic search
- Explain the Random Projection method and its benefits
- Execute an end-to-end predictive modeling project using a large dataset
