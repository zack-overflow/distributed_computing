## INTRODUCTION

In this module, we begin with model selection and tuning in the ML library. Then we fetch a repo to get hands-on with Topic Modeling.
Data scientists often need to find and execute pre-existing code, and this will increase our experience while learning more NLP.
Lastly, in the programming assignment, you will tune an ML model and run topic modeling on your own.

 

## Learning Objectives

At the conclusion of this module, you should be able to:

- Tune Spark MLlib models
- Execute a topic modeling job
- Progress toward executing an end-to-end predictive modeling project using a large dataset.
